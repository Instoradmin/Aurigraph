      <h2 class="main-feature-title"><strong>Double-entry Bookkeeping</strong></h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Since the 1500s, accounting and bookkeeping have followed the practice of<strong> Double-entry Bookkeeping.</strong> It implies that every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. The double-entry has two equal and corresponding sides known as debit and credit. The left-hand side is debit while the right-hand side is credit.Â <br><br>For instance, recording a sale of $100 might require two entries: a debit of $100 to an account named &quot;Cash&quot; and a credit of $100 to an account named &quot;Revenue.&quot;<br><br><strong>Assets = Equities + Liabilities<br><br></strong>The accounting equation is an error detection tool; if at any point the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts, an error has occurred. However, satisfying the equation does not guarantee that there are no errors; the ledger may still &quot;balance&quot; even if the wrong ledger accounts have been debited or credited.<br></p><img style="width: 900px"  src="images/1_img-min.jpg" alt="" class="browser-mockup-right"></div>

      <h2 class="main-feature-title"><strong>Triple Entry Accounting</strong></h2>
      <p class="paragraph-2">Triple entry accounting has an enhancement over the conventional system as all the accounting entries involving outside parties that are cryptographically sealed by a third entry. These may include purchases of inventory and supplies, sales, tax and utility payments, and other expenses. The bookkeeping entries of both parties are placed beside each other to ensure that the given transaction is congruent. A seller books debit to account for cash received, and a buyer books a credit for cash spent in the same transaction, however, in separate sets of accounting records. This is where blockchain and DLTs come in: rather than these entries occurring separately in independent sets of books, they occur in the form of a transfer between individual ledgers of the two parties that reflect in the same distributed public ledger, creating an interlocking system of enduring accounting records. Since the entries are distributed and cryptographically sealed, their immutability and transparency are assured.</p>

      <div class="section-description">Aurigraph DLT offers real-time reconciliation and audits across multiple ledgers while reducing the effort and cost of executing the same. Unlike conventional double-entry bookkeeping, Aurigraph DLT offers reconciliation not just among pairs of ledgers but also value chains that will have a combination of transactions like splitting, merging, returns and reversals of transactions. Transactions requiring splitting, merging and returns in a sequence of transactions becomes very tedious to track and trace the details and reconcile multiple hops of the transaction. Moreover, commercial transactions with incumbent transaction amounts and taxes have multiple splitting, merging and returning of goods and services.</div>

            <p class="paragraph-4">A â<strong>Forward</strong>â transaction is one in which the operating node sends multiple transactions as a single transaction to the next recipient.

            <p>A â<strong>Return</strong>â transaction is one in which the operating node returns a received transaction to the sender of the transaction, in part or full. For example, a Company B receives 100 units of an item from a Company A and may wish to return all or some of the items while paying for the rest of items to Company A. Company B initiates the return as two different transactions, one of goods and the other as payment Â for accounts to be reconciled with full settlement of quantities, amount and tax.</p>

            <p>A â<strong>Split</strong>â transaction is one during which an operating node splits a single input transaction into two or more nodes with multiple attributes. For example, Company A receives 100 units of an item and then splits them into two batches of 50 each and sends each of the batches to two downstream buyers. The reconciliation requires Company A to receive payments from both the buyers and reconcile accounts with its bank transactions as well as buyers.</p>

For example, a Manufacturer receives 100 sets of five components from five different vendors to manufacture 100 units of a finished product, thus âmergingâ the components into one unit each and sends them to the next stakeholder in the value chain.</p>

          <h4 > COVID 19 Vaccination Problem Statement</h4>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">COVID-19 Vaccine is just being released after the pandemic has ravaged the world in 2020. Most Vaccines have been inadequately tested, and that too on a limited demography and small sample size for less than 3 months. The duration of immunity has also not been verified and may vary randomly. The efficacy and the effectiveness of the COVID 19 Vaccine is suspect on a much larger population. Further most vaccines need multiple doses spread over 14 to 28 days.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">From a Logistics perspective, these vaccines require to be tracked to the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; where they will be administered to the Beneficiaries. Hospitals will need to be equipped with necessary &ldquo;super-cold storage&rdquo; facilities and delivery equipment such as diagnostic labs, syringes, PPEs, and facilities to administer vaccinations over multiple doses across geographies seamlessly while providing crowd management and equitable distribution of vaccines, beneficiaries and hospitals. A well-managed supply chain will aid the government to better manage the Vaccine distribution optimally to manage the demand-supply issues without burdening the already fatigued beneficiaries.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">After a beneficiary has received the I-Pass, the beneficiary may present the I-Pass to gain access to public amenities such as public transport (airports, rail and road transport), offices, malls, international travel and such.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">A centralized solution will not be able to deliver for the volume of transactions while registering and administering vaccinations and the even higher demands when verifications need to be done over a longer period. As the virus has begun to mutate and multiple strains are being revealed, a longer-term solution that is robust, secure, scalable and lightweight that can be rapidly rolled out.</p>

          <h4 >About Aurigraph I-Pass</h4>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="western">Aurigraph I-pass delivers:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Easy Beneficiary, hospital, and verifier onboarding with validated authentication</p>
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Single dashboard for Government to track beneficiaries, vaccination centres and vaccination inventory in real-time</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Single certified Immunity Pass for Beneficiary to access public amenities such as offices, public transport and common areas such as Malls, restaurants and hotels.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Post-Vax Event reporting by Beneficiary to deliver the first response to the beneficiary and reporting to Vaccine provider.</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Government</h4>
 
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">With Aurigraph I-Pass, Government and administrators can plan, mobilize, and track in real-time beneficiary registrations and demand for vaccinations, PPE, syringes and associated medical kits with appropriate resources to the nearest proximity. The I-Pass platform will enable administrators to manage and replenish inventories in real-time without effort or breakdowns while getting accurate reporting on beneficiary vaccinations and the post-vaccination events.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">Separate reporting and analytical dashboards are available for Vaccine inventory management, hospitals and beneficiaries with drill-down for analytics.</p>
          <h4>COVID Command Centres</h4>

          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">The supply chain management with integrated real-time Track-and-Trace will help the COVID Command centre to plan, manage and track the inventory movement of the vaccines, batch and expiry to ensure optimal delivery to beneficiaries across the country and states.&nbsp;Dashboards can help better decision making and proactive first response in case of emergencies for each location</p>
          <h4>Hospitals and Vaccination delivery centres</h4>
  
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">Hospitals and clinics can schedule beneficiaries for their vaccination and booster doses based on optimal scheduling while ensuring inventory availability at the right place. Vaccine inventory is updated in real-time and replenished from the command centre as they receive fresh inventory from the government through the command centre. Hospitals can view the calendar requests and filter and sort beneficiaries based on given Priorities and inventory to schedule slots. When the beneficiary arrives at the hospital, the staff can just scan the appointment QR code and retrieve the beneficiary&rsquo;s profile. The hospital may conduct and record further diagnosis including Antibodies tests to verify pre-existing conditions before administering the vaccination. Hospitals across geographies may repeat the same process for subsequent dosages as well. If a beneficiary were to face aftereffects or COVID infection later, the Beneficiary can escalate the issue through I-Pass to receive medical care from first responders or hospitals or facilities.</p>
      
          <h4>Verifiers&nbsp;</h4>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">As time progresses and enough beneficiaries have been vaccinated, they will also need to be verified for vaccination to access offices, public amenities, travel and tourism and schools. Verifiers can scan Aurigraph I-pass of a beneficiary to immediately verify vaccination and admit the beneficiary.&nbsp;A scanned I-pass will only present the QR code and the user&rsquo;s verified photograph for identification, protecting the beneficiary&rsquo;s privacy.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">In the case of Government, enterprises, and airports, they may optionally integrate I-Pass with respective People Management and HR systems. The entire verification system can be under strain when the number of concurrent verification requests that may occur when a large number of beneficiaries are entering offices, airports and other public amenities at the same time. Aurigraph I-Pass is the only platform that can handle over 100000 concurrent verifications per second, thus not resulting in large crowds or queues at public places.</p>
          <h4 >Beneficiaries</h4>
          </li>
          </ol>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">A Beneficiary can search for a nearby hospital offering vaccination at a mutually convenient time with an appropriate inventory of Vaccine, staff and resources in advance using a smartphone, feature phone or by a caretaker.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" class="western">The Beneficiary can register using</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Aadhar card scan or Digilocker authentication</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Report existing ailments, comorbidities and prescriptions, if any.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p class="paragraph">In case of priority segments like health workers, armed forces and other frontline workers, their ID Cards scan may be uploaded.</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">Upon a confirmed slot from the hospital, the Beneficiary will receive a unique Appointment QR Code for each of the dosages which on presenting at the hospital, will retrieve beneficiary identity details and stated health conditions for verification to the hospital staff for further tests, antibodies tests and vaccine administration.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">After the full course of vaccination, the beneficiary will receive I-Pass e-certificate QR Code which may be presented to verifiers to access public amenities such as airports, rail and bus stations, restaurants and hotels, malls, and offices. All the beneficiary data is stored in their respective nodes with the beneficiary having full control on providing access to third parties.</p>
          <h4 >Beneficiary Privacy</h4>
          </li>
          </ol>
          </ol>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">Each beneficiary will have an independent node with its own Digi-vault for beneficiary health data with biometric authentication, including COVID I-pass being stored in the user's Aadhar-linked DigiLocker, GOI. Aurigraph I-pass will only be processing the user application, hospital scheduling and verifier management. To maintain complete Beneficiary privacy and data security, all the personally identifiable information and medical reports will be stored in the user&rsquo;s Digivault/Digilocker to ensure that its available only through the consent of the Beneficiary. Each Beneficiary has a dedicated Aurigraph Node with isolated data and application, thereby eliminating a single point of failure or data breach.</p>

          <h4>Scalability</h4>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">Aurigraph I-pass is built on a highly scalable and extremely high throughput DLT with multi-layer data security in transit and at rest that can support a throughput of over 100000 Transactions per second with a latency of under 500 ms. With millions of beneficiaries to be vaccinated, Aurigraph I-Pass provides a tamper-proof system that can be rolled out very rapidly in under 2 weeks across a vast country like India with Aadhar's Sovereign Identity authentication and Aurigraph's Decentralized Identity system, ensuring extremely high throughput and user security, eliminating the single point of failure.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph" align="justify">High throughput of the platform will be required when large number of beneficiaries need to access public amenities in airports, train stations and other public transport for verification across the world.&nbsp;</p>
